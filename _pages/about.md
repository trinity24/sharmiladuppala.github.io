I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research is on fairness in online matching algorithms, machine learning and resource allocation. I am co-advised by Prof. Aravind Srinivasan and Prof. John Dickerson. 

Before joining UMD, I graduated with a Masters in Computer Science from Stony Brook University where I was advised by Prof. Rezaul Chowdhary. My Master's thesis titled Optimizing Two Systems Employing Reducers is centered around resource allocation in shared memory systems and scheduling in MapReduce systems. I was also associated with IACS (Institute for Advanced Computational Studies).
